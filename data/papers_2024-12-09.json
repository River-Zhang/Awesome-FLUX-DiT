    "abstract": "Real-world videos consist of sequences of events. Generating such sequences with precise temporal control is infeasible with existing video generators that rely on a single paragraph of text as input. When tasked with generating multiple events described using a single prompt, such methods often ignore some of the events or fail to arrange them in the correct order. To address this limitation, we present MinT, a multi-event video generator with temporal control. Our key insight is to bind each event to a specific period in the generated video, which allows the model to focus on one event at a time. To enable time-aware interactions between event captions and video tokens, we design a time-based positional encoding method, dubbed ReRoPE. This encoding helps to guide the cross-attention operation. By fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion transformer on temporally grounded data, our approach produces coherent videos with smoothly connected events. For the first time in the literature, our model offers control over the timing of events in generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MinT outperforms existing open-source models by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have been recognized for their ability to generate images that are not only visually appealing but also of high artistic quality. As a result, Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation has been proposed to leverage region-specific positions and descriptions to enable more precise and controllable generation. However, previous methods primarily focus on UNet-based models (e.g., SD1.5 and SDXL), and limited effort has explored Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs), which have demonstrated powerful image generation capabilities. Enabling MM-DiT for layout-to-image generation seems straightforward but is challenging due to the complexity of how layout is introduced, integrated, and balanced among multiple modalities. To this end, we explore various network variants to efficiently incorporate layout guidance into MM-DiT, and ultimately present SiamLayout. To Inherit the advantages of MM-DiT, we use a separate set of network weights to process the layout, treating it as equally important as the image and text modalities. Meanwhile, to alleviate the competition among modalities, we decouple the image-layout interaction into a siamese branch alongside the image-text one and fuse them in the later stage. Moreover, we contribute a large-scale layout dataset, named LayoutSAM, which includes 2.7 million image-text pairs and 10.7 million entities. Each entity is annotated with a bounding box and a detailed description. We further construct the LayoutSAM-Eval benchmark as a comprehensive tool for evaluating the L2I generation quality. Finally, we introduce the Layout Designer, which taps into the potential of large language models in layout planning, transforming them into experts in layout generation and optimization. Our code, model, and dataset will be available at https://creatilayout.github.io.",

We introduce a Navigation World Model (NWM), a controllable video generation model that predicts future visual observations based on past observations and navigation actions. To capture complex environment dynamics, NWM employs a Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), trained on a diverse collection of egocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, and scaled up to 1 billion parameters. In familiar environments, NWM can plan navigation trajectories by simulating them and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal. Unlike supervised navigation policies with fixed behavior, NWM can dynamically incorporate constraints during planning. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in planning trajectories from scratch or by ranking trajectories sampled from an external policy. Furthermore, NWM leverages its learned visual priors to imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input image, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation systems.",

    "abstract": "Generating multi-view videos for autonomous driving training has recently gained much attention, with the challenge of addressing both cross-view and cross-frame consistency. Existing methods typically apply decoupled attention mechanisms for spatial, temporal, and view dimensions. However, these approaches often struggle to maintain consistency across dimensions, particularly when handling fast-moving objects that appear at different times and viewpoints. In this paper, we present CogDriving, a novel network designed for synthesizing high-quality multi-view driving videos. CogDriving leverages a Diffusion Transformer architecture with holistic-4D attention modules, enabling simultaneous associations across the spatial, temporal, and viewpoint dimensions. We also propose a lightweight controller tailored for CogDriving, i.e., Micro-Controller, which uses only 1.1% of the parameters of the standard ControlNet, enabling precise control over Bird's-Eye-View layouts. To enhance the generation of object instances crucial for autonomous driving, we propose a re-weighted learning objective, dynamically adjusting the learning weights for object instances during training. CogDriving demonstrates strong performance on the nuScenes validation set, achieving an FVD score of 37.8, highlighting its ability to generate realistic driving videos.

    "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in text-guided and image-conditioned image generation. However, existing diffusion models cannot simultaneously generate a segmentation map of objects and a corresponding image from the prompt. Previous attempts either generate segmentation maps based on the images or provide maps as input conditions to control image generation, limiting their functionality to given inputs. Incorporating an inherent understanding of the scene layouts can improve the creativity and realism of diffusion models. To address this limitation, we present Panoptic Diffusion Model (PDM), the first model designed to generate both images and panoptic segmentation maps concurrently. PDM bridges the gap between image and text by constructing segmentation layouts that provide detailed, built-in guidance throughout the generation process. This ensures the inclusion of categories mentioned in text prompts and enriches the diversity of segments within the background. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PDM across two architectures: a unified diffusion transformer and a two-stream transformer with a pretrained backbone. To facilitate co-generation with fewer sampling steps, we incorporate a fast diffusion solver into PDM. Additionally, when ground-truth maps are available, PDM can function as a text-guided image-to-image generation model. Finally, we propose a novel metric for evaluating the quality of generated maps and show that PDM achieves state-of-the-art results in image generation with implicit scene control.",

However, if one asks the generator to synthesize a particular camera setting such as creating different fields of view using a 24mm lens versus a 70mm lens, the generator will not be able to interpret and generate scene-consistent images. This limitation not only hinders the adoption of generative tools in photography applications but also exemplifies a broader issue of bridging the gap between the data-driven models and the physical world. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Generative Photography, a framework designed to control camera intrinsic settings during content generation. The core innovation of this work are the concepts of Dimensionality Lifting and Contrastive Camera Learning, which achieve continuous and consistent transitions for different camera settings. Experimental results show that our method produces significantly more scene-consistent photorealistic images than state-of-the-art models such as Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.",

To address this, we propose World-consistent Video Diffusion (WVD), a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D supervision using XYZ images, which encode global 3D coordinates for each image pixel. More specifically, we train a diffusion transformer to learn the joint distribution of RGB and XYZ frames. This approach supports multi-task adaptability via a flexible inpainting strategy. For example, WVD can estimate XYZ frames from ground-truth RGB or generate novel RGB frames using XYZ projections along a specified camera trajectory. In doing so, WVD unifies tasks like single-image-to-3D generation, multi-view stereo, and camera-controlled video generation. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, providing a scalable solution for 3D-consistent video and image generation with a single pretrained model.",

Our plug-in architecture accommodates the original DiT parameters, facilitating diverse types of camera poses and flexible object movement.

In this work, we present TinyFusion, a depth pruning method designed to remove redundant layers from diffusion transformers via end-to-end learning. The core principle of our approach is to create a pruned model with high recoverability, allowing it to regain strong performance after fine-tuning. To accomplish this, we introduce a differentiable sampling technique to make pruning learnable, paired with a co-optimized parameter to simulate future fine-tuning. While prior works focus on minimizing loss or error after pruning, our method explicitly models and optimizes the post-fine-tuning performance of pruned models. Experimental results indicate that this learnable paradigm offers substantial benefits for layer pruning of diffusion transformers, surpassing existing importance-based and error-based methods. Additionally, TinyFusion exhibits strong generalization across diverse architectures, such as DiTs, MARs, and SiTs. Experiments with DiT-XL show that TinyFusion can craft a shallow diffusion transformer at less than 7% of the pre-training cost, achieving a 2$\\times$ speedup with an FID score of 2.86, outperforming competitors with comparable efficiency.

Sate-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), Flux, and AuraFlow still struggle with accurate text depiction, resulting in misspelled or inconsistent text. We introduce a training-free method with minimal computational overhead that significantly enhances text rendering quality. Specifically, we introduce an overshooting sampler for pretrained rectified flow (RF) models, by alternating between over-simulating the learned ordinary differential equation (ODE) and reintroducing noise. Compared to the Euler sampler, the overshooting sampler effectively introduces an extra Langevin dynamics term that can help correct the compounding error from successive Euler steps and therefore improve the text rendering. However, when the overshooting strength is high, we observe over-smoothing artifacts on the generated images. To address this issue, we propose an Attention Modulated Overshooting sampler (AMO), which adaptively controls the strength of overshooting for each image patch according to their attention score with the text content. AMO demonstrates a 32.3% and 35.9% improvement in text rendering accuracy on SD3 and Flux without compromising overall image quality or increasing inference cost.",

To validate the efficacy of this dataset and the associated training strategies, we propose an extension of existing classical diffusion transformer architectures and conduct further pretraining of our models on the proposed dataset.

Second, the effective alignment of text with human appearance, human motion, and facial motion is essential for producing high-quality video outputs. Based on these insights and corresponding methodologies, the straightforward extended network trained on the proposed dataset demonstrates an obvious improvement in the generation of human-centric videos.

In this work, we analyze camera motion from a first principles perspective, uncovering insights that enable precise 3D camera manipulation without compromising synthesis quality. First, we determine that motion induced by camera movements in videos is low-frequency in nature. This motivates us to adjust train and test pose conditioning schedules, accelerating training convergence while improving visual and motion quality. Then, by probing the representations of an unconditional video diffusion transformer, we observe that they implicitly perform camera pose estimation under the hood, and only a sub-portion of their layers contain the camera information. This suggested us to limit the injection of camera conditioning to a subset of the architecture to prevent interference with other video features, leading to 4x reduction of training parameters, improved training speed and 10% higher visual quality. Finally, we complement the typical dataset for camera control learning with a curated dataset of 20K diverse dynamic videos with stationary cameras. This helps the model disambiguate the difference between camera and scene motion, and improves the dynamics of generated pose-conditioned videos.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image generation tasks, including image editing and video creation, representing a good understanding of the physical world. On the other line, diffusion models have also shown promise in robotic control tasks by denoising actions, known as diffusion policy. Although the diffusion generative model and diffusion policy exhibit distinct capabilities--image prediction and robotic action, respectively--they technically follow a similar denoising process. In robotic tasks, the ability to predict future images and generate actions is highly correlated since they share the same underlying dynamics of the physical world. Building on this insight, we introduce PAD, a novel visual policy learning framework that unifies image Prediction and robot Action within a joint Denoising process. Specifically, PAD utilizes Diffusion Transformers (DiT) to seamlessly integrate images and robot states, enabling the simultaneous prediction of future images and robot actions. Additionally, PAD supports co-training on both robotic demonstrations and large-scale video datasets and can be easily extended to other robotic modalities, such as depth images. PAD outperforms previous methods, achieving a significant 26.3% relative improvement on the full Metaworld benchmark, by utilizing a single text-conditioned visual policy within a data-efficient imitation learning setting. Furthermore, PAD demonstrates superior generalization to unseen tasks in real-world robot manipulation settings with 28.0% success rate increase compared to the strongest baseline.

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiT), an emerging image and video generation model architecture, has demonstrated great potential because of its high generation quality and scalability properties. Despite the impressive performance, its practical deployment is constrained by computational complexity and redundancy in the sequential denoising process. While feature caching across timesteps has proven effective in accelerating diffusion models, its application to DiT is limited by fundamental architectural differences from U-Net-based approaches. Through empirical analysis of DiT feature dynamics, we identify that significant feature variation between DiT blocks presents a key challenge for feature reusability. To address this, we convert standard DiT into Skip-DiT with skip branches to enhance feature smoothness. Further, we introduce Skip-Cache which utilizes the skip branches to cache DiT features across timesteps at the inference time. We validated effectiveness of our proposal on different DiT backbones for video and image generation, showcasing skip branches to help preserve generation quality and achieve higher speedup. Experimental results indicate that Skip-DiT achieves a 1.5x speedup almost for free and a 2.2x speedup with only a minor reduction in quantitative metrics.

    "abstract": "Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity. It is an important task in video generation but remains an open problem for generative models. This paper pushes the technical frontier of IPT2V in two directions that have not been resolved in literature: (1) A tuning-free pipeline without tedious case-by-case finetuning, and (2) A frequency-aware heuristic identity-preserving DiT-based control scheme. We propose ConsisID, a tuning-free DiT-based controllable IPT2V model to keep human identity consistent in the generated video. Inspired by prior findings in frequency analysis of diffusion transformers, it employs identity-control signals in the frequency domain, where facial features can be decomposed into low-frequency global features and high-frequency intrinsic features. First, from a low-frequency perspective, we introduce a global facial extractor, which encodes reference images and facial key points into a latent space, generating features enriched with low-frequency information. These features are then integrated into shallow layers of the network to alleviate training challenges associated with DiT. Second, from a high-frequency perspective, we design a local facial extractor to capture high-frequency details and inject them into transformer blocks, enhancing the model's ability to preserve fine-grained features. We propose a hierarchical training strategy to leverage frequency information for identity preservation, transforming a vanilla pre-trained video generation model into an IPT2V model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our frequency-aware heuristic scheme provides an optimal control solution for DiT-based models. Thanks to this scheme, our ConsisID generates high-quality, identity-preserving videos, making strides towards more effective IPT2V.",

Unlike existing methods, which rely heavily on additional encoder modules with complex architectures, OminiControl (1) effectively and efficiently incorporates injected image conditions with only ~0.1% additional parameters, and (2) addresses a wide range of image conditioning tasks in a unified manner, including subject-driven generation and spatially-aligned conditions such as edges, depth, and more. Remarkably, these capabilities are achieved by training on images generated by the DiT itself, which is particularly beneficial for subject-driven generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that OminiControl outperforms existing UNet-based and DiT-adapted models in both subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditional generation.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of content synthesis and editing. Recent models have replaced the traditional UNet architecture with the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), and employed flow-matching for improved training and sampling. However, they exhibit limited generation diversity. In this work, we leverage this limitation to perform consistent image edits via selective injection of attention features. The main challenge is that, unlike the UNet-based models, DiT lacks a coarse-to-fine synthesis structure, making it unclear in which layers to perform the injection. Therefore, we propose an automatic method to identify \"vital layers\" within DiT, crucial for image formation, and demonstrate how these layers facilitate a range of controlled stable edits, from non-rigid modifications to object addition, using the same mechanism. Next, to enable real-image editing, we introduce an improved image inversion method for flow models. Finally, we evaluate our approach through qualitative and quantitative comparisons, along with a user study, and demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple applications.

To tackle these issues, we propose innovative time-aware quantization for DiTs (TaQ-DiT). Specifically, (1) we observe a non-convergence issue when reconstructing weights and activations separately during quantization and introduce a joint reconstruction method to resolve this problem. (2) We discover that Post-GELU activations are particularly sensitive to quantization due to their significant variability across different denoising steps as well as extreme asymmetries and variations within each step. To address this, we propose time-variance-aware transformations to facilitate more effective quantization. Experimental results show that when quantizing DiTs' weights to 4-bit and activations to 8-bit (W4A8), our method significantly surpasses previous quantization methods.",

To alleviate this problem, we propose a drop-in replacement for MHA called the Polynomial Mixer (PoM) that has the benefit of encoding the entire sequence into an explicit state. PoM has a linear complexity with respect to the number of tokens. This explicit state also allows us to generate frames in a sequential fashion, minimizing memory and compute requirement, while still being able to train in parallel. We show the Polynomial Mixer is a universal sequence-to-sequence approximator, just like regular MHA.

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently achieved remarkable success in text-guided image generation. In image editing, DiTs project text and image inputs to a joint latent space, from which they decode and synthesize new images. However, it remains largely unexplored how multimodal information collectively forms this joint space and how they guide the semantics of the synthesized images. In this paper, we investigate the latent space of DiT models and uncover two key properties: First, DiT's latent space is inherently semantically disentangled, where different semantic attributes can be controlled by specific editing directions. Second, consistent semantic editing requires utilizing the entire joint latent space, as neither encoded image nor text alone contains enough semantic information. We show that these editing directions can be obtained directly from text prompts, enabling precise semantic control without additional training or mask annotations. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective Encode-Identify-Manipulate (EIM) framework for zero-shot fine-grained image editing. Specifically, we first encode both the given source image and the text prompt that describes the image, to obtain the joint latent embedding. Then, using our proposed Hessian Score Distillation Sampling (HSDS) method, we identify editing directions that control specific target attributes while preserving other image features. These directions are guided by text prompts and used to manipulate the latent embeddings. Moreover, we propose a new metric to quantify the disentanglement degree of the latent space of diffusion models. Extensive experiment results on our new curated benchmark dataset and analysis demonstrate DiT's disentanglement properties and effectiveness of the EIM framework.",

Despite their robust generative capabilities, these models often struggle with inversion inaccuracies, which could further limit their effectiveness in downstream tasks such as image and video editing.

Specifically, we derive the exact formulation of the rectified flow ODE and apply the high-order Taylor expansion to estimate its nonlinear components, significantly enhancing the precision of ODE solutions at each timestep. Building upon RF-Solver, we further propose RF-Edit, a general feature-sharing-based framework for image and video editing. By incorporating self-attention features from the inversion process into the editing process, RF-Edit effectively preserves the structural information of the source image or video while achieving high-quality editing results. Our approach is compatible with any pre-trained rectified-flow-based models for image and video tasks, requiring no additional training or optimization. Extensive experiments across generation, inversion, and editing tasks in both image and video modalities demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our method.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in UNet-based image editing, methods for shape-aware object editing in high-resolution images are still lacking. Compared to UNet, Diffusion Transformers (DiT) demonstrate superior capabilities to effectively capture the long-range dependencies among patches, leading to higher-quality image generation. In this paper, we propose DiT4Edit, the first Diffusion Transformer-based image editing framework. Specifically, DiT4Edit uses the DPM-Solver inversion algorithm to obtain the inverted latents, reducing the number of steps compared to the DDIM inversion algorithm commonly used in UNet-based frameworks. Additionally, we design unified attention control and patches merging, tailored for transformer computation streams. This integration allows our framework to generate higher-quality edited images faster. Our design leverages the advantages of DiT, enabling it to surpass UNet structures in image editing, especially in high-resolution and arbitrary-size images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of DiT4Edit across various editing scenarios, highlighting the potential of Diffusion Transformers in supporting image editing.",

    "abstract": "Generating temporally-consistent high-fidelity videos can be computationally expensive, especially over longer temporal spans. More-recent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) -- despite making significant headway in this context -- have only heightened such challenges as they rely on larger models and heavier attention mechanisms, resulting in slower inference speeds. In this paper, we introduce a training-free method to accelerate video DiTs, termed Adaptive Caching (AdaCache), which is motivated by the fact that \"not all videos are created equal\": meaning, some videos require fewer denoising steps to attain a reasonable quality than others. Building on this, we not only cache computations through the diffusion process, but also devise a caching schedule tailored to each video generation, maximizing the quality-latency trade-off. We further introduce a Motion Regularization (MoReg) scheme to utilize video information within AdaCache, essentially controlling the compute allocation based on motion content. Altogether, our plug-and-play contributions grant significant inference speedups (e.g. up to 4.7x on Open-Sora 720p - 2s video generation) without sacrificing the generation quality, across multiple video DiT baselines.",

This model facilitates high-quality, open-domain generation by simulating an extensive array of game engine features, such as innovative characters, dynamic environments, complex actions, and diverse events. Additionally, it provides interactive controllability, predicting and altering future content based on the current clip, thus allowing for gameplay simulation. To realize this vision, we first collected and built an Open-World Video Game Dataset from scratch. It is the first and largest dataset for open-world game video generation and control, which comprises over a million diverse gameplay video clips sampling from over 150 games with informative captions from GPT-4o. GameGen-X undergoes a two-stage training process, consisting of foundation model pre-training and instruction tuning. Firstly, the model was pre-trained via text-to-video generation and video continuation, endowing it with the capability for long-sequence, high-quality open-domain game video generation. Further, to achieve interactive controllability, we designed InstructNet to incorporate game-related multi-modal control signal experts. This allows the model to adjust latent representations based on user inputs, unifying character interaction and scene content control for the first time in video generation. During instruction tuning, only the InstructNet is updated while the pre-trained foundation model is frozen, enabling the integration of interactive controllability without loss of diversity and quality of generated video content.",

    "abstract": "Recent research arXiv:2410.15027 has explored the use of diffusion transformers (DiTs) for task-agnostic image generation by simply concatenating attention tokens across images. However, despite substantial computational resources, the fidelity of the generated images remains suboptimal. In this study, we reevaluate and streamline this framework by hypothesizing that text-to-image DiTs inherently possess in-context generation capabilities, requiring only minimal tuning to activate them. Through diverse task experiments, we qualitatively demonstrate that existing text-to-image DiTs can effectively perform in-context generation without any tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple pipeline to leverage the in-context abilities of DiTs: (1) concatenate images instead of tokens, (2) perform joint captioning of multiple images, and (3) apply task-specific LoRA tuning using small datasets (e.g., 20~100 samples) instead of full-parameter tuning with large datasets. We name our models In-Context LoRA (IC-LoRA). This approach requires no modifications to the original DiT models, only changes to the training data. Remarkably, our pipeline generates high-fidelity image sets that better adhere to prompts. While task-specific in terms of tuning data, our framework remains task-agnostic in architecture and pipeline, offering a powerful tool for the community and providing valuable insights for further research on product-level task-agnostic generation systems.

However, these models sometimes fail to accurately capture all the details specified in the input prompts, particularly concerning entities, attributes, and spatial relationships. This issue becomes more pronounced when the prompt contains novel or complex compositions, leading to what are known as compositional generation failure modes. Recently, a new open-source diffusion-based T2I model, FLUX, has been introduced, demonstrating strong performance in high-quality image generation. Additionally, autoregressive T2I models like LlamaGen have claimed competitive visual quality performance compared to diffusion-based models. In this study, we evaluate the compositional generation capabilities of these newly introduced models against established models using the T2I-CompBench benchmark. Our findings reveal that LlamaGen, as a vanilla autoregressive model, is not yet on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models for compositional generation tasks under the same criteria, such as model size and inference time. On the other hand, the open-source diffusion-based model FLUX exhibits compositional generation capabilities comparable to the state-of-the-art closed-source model DALL-E3.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-video models have recently undergone rapid and substantial advancements. Nevertheless, due to limitations in data and computational resources, achieving efficient generation of long videos with rich motion dynamics remains a significant challenge. To generate high-quality, dynamic, and temporally consistent long videos, this paper presents ARLON, a novel framework that boosts diffusion Transformers with autoregressive models for long video generation, by integrating the coarse spatial and long-range temporal information provided by the AR model to guide the DiT model. Specifically, ARLON incorporates several key innovations: 1) A latent Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) compresses the input latent space of the DiT model into compact visual tokens, bridging the AR and DiT models and balancing the learning complexity and information density; 2) An adaptive norm-based semantic injection module integrates the coarse discrete visual units from the AR model into the DiT model, ensuring effective guidance during video generation; 3) To enhance the tolerance capability of noise introduced from the AR inference, the DiT model is trained with coarser visual latent tokens incorporated with an uncertainty sampling module. Experimental results demonstrate that ARLON significantly outperforms the baseline OpenSora-V1.2 on eight out of eleven metrics selected from VBench, with notable improvements in dynamic degree and aesthetic quality, while delivering competitive results on the remaining three and simultaneously accelerating the generation process. In addition, ARLON achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation. Detailed analyses of the improvements in inference efficiency are presented, alongside a practical application that demonstrates the generation of long videos using progressive text prompts.

Spatial grounding with bounding boxes has gained attention for its simplicity and versatility, allowing for enhanced user control in image generation. However, prior training-free approaches often rely on updating the noisy image during the reverse diffusion process via backpropagation from custom loss functions, which frequently struggle to provide precise control over individual bounding boxes. In this work, we leverage the flexibility of the Transformer architecture, demonstrating that DiT can generate noisy patches corresponding to each bounding box, fully encoding the target object and allowing for fine-grained control over each region. Our approach builds on an intriguing property of DiT, which we refer to as semantic sharing. Due to semantic sharing, when a smaller patch is jointly denoised alongside a generatable-size image, the two become semantic clones. Each patch is denoised in its own branch of the generation process and then transplanted into the corresponding region of the original noisy image at each timestep, resulting in robust spatial grounding for each bounding box. In our experiments on the HRS and DrawBench benchmarks, we achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to previous training-free approaches.",

In the context of this reality, existing diffusion models, such as Diffusion Transformers, often face challenges when processing image resolutions outside of their trained domain. To address this limitation, we conceptualize images as sequences of tokens with dynamic sizes, rather than traditional methods that perceive images as fixed-resolution grids. This perspective enables a flexible training strategy that seamlessly accommodates various aspect ratios during both training and inference, thus promoting resolution generalization and eliminating biases introduced by image cropping. On this basis, we present the \\textbf{Flexible Vision Transformer} (FiT), a transformer architecture specifically designed for generating images with \\textit{unrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios}. We further upgrade the FiT to FiTv2 with several innovative designs, includingthe Query-Key vector normalization, the AdaLN-LoRA module, a rectified flow scheduler, and a Logit-Normal sampler. Enhanced by a meticulously adjusted network structure, FiTv2 exhibits $2\\times$ convergence speed of FiT. When incorporating advanced training-free extrapolation techniques, FiTv2 demonstrates remarkable adaptability in both resolution extrapolation and diverse resolution generation. Additionally, our exploration of the scalability of the FiTv2 model reveals that larger models exhibit better computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient post-training strategy to adapt a pre-trained model for the high-resolution generation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the exceptional performance of FiTv2 across a broad range of resolutions.

While U-Net-based models have shown promising results for camera control, transformer-based diffusion models (DiT)-the preferred architecture for large-scale video generation - suffer from severe degradation in camera motion accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the underlying causes of this issue and propose solutions tailored to DiT architectures. Our study reveals that camera control performance depends heavily on the choice of conditioning methods rather than camera pose representations that is commonly believed. To address the persistent motion degradation in DiT, we introduce Camera Motion Guidance (CMG), based on classifier-free guidance, which boosts camera control by over 400%. Additionally, we present a sparse camera control pipeline, significantly simplifying the process of specifying camera poses for long videos. Our method universally applies to both U-Net and DiT models, offering improved camera control for video generation tasks.",

This paper addresses two key tasks: (i) inversion and (ii) editing of a real image using stochastic equivalents of rectified flow models (such as Flux). Although Diffusion Models (DMs) have recently dominated the field of generative modeling for images, their inversion presents faithfulness and editability challenges due to nonlinearities in drift and diffusion. Existing state-of-the-art DM inversion approaches rely on training of additional parameters or test-time optimization of latent variables; both are expensive in practice. Rectified Flows (RFs) offer a promising alternative to diffusion models, yet their inversion has been underexplored. We propose RF inversion using dynamic optimal control derived via a linear quadratic regulator. We prove that the resulting vector field is equivalent to a rectified stochastic differential equation. Additionally, we extend our framework to design a stochastic sampler for Flux. Our inversion method allows for state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot inversion and editing, outperforming prior works in stroke-to-image synthesis and semantic image editing, with large-scale human evaluations confirming user preference.",

Therefore, experiments across a broad range of compute budgets, from 1e17 to 6e18 FLOPs are conducted to confirm the existence of scaling laws in DiT for the first time. Concretely, the loss of pretraining DiT also follows a power-law relationship with the involved compute. Based on the scaling law, we can not only determine the optimal model size and required data but also accurately predict the text-to-image generation loss given a model with 1B parameters and a compute budget of 1e21 FLOPs. Additionally, we also demonstrate that the trend of pre-training loss matches the generation performances (e.g., FID), even across various datasets, which complements the mapping from compute to synthesis quality and thus provides a predictable benchmark that assesses model performance and data quality at a reduced cost.",

However, these methods typically exhibit distinct strengths for compositional generation, with some excelling in handling attribute binding and others in spatial relationships. This disparity highlights the need for an approach that can leverage the complementary strengths of various models to comprehensively improve the composition capability. To this end, we introduce IterComp, a novel framework that aggregates composition-aware model preferences from multiple models and employs an iterative feedback learning approach to enhance compositional generation. Specifically, we curate a gallery of six powerful open-source diffusion models and evaluate their three key compositional metrics: attribute binding, spatial relationships, and non-spatial relationships. Based on these metrics, we develop a composition-aware model preference dataset comprising numerous image-rank pairs to train composition-aware reward models. Then, we propose an iterative feedback learning method to enhance compositionality in a closed-loop manner, enabling the progressive self-refinement of both the base diffusion model and reward models over multiple iterations. Theoretical proof demonstrates the effectiveness and extensive experiments show our significant superiority over previous SOTA methods (e.g., Omost and FLUX), particularly in multi-category object composition and complex semantic alignment. IterComp opens new research avenues in reward feedback learning for diffusion models and compositional generation. Code: https://github.com/YangLing0818/IterComp",

    "abstract": "Video generation requires modeling a vast spatiotemporal space, which demands significant computational resources and data usage. To reduce the complexity, the prevailing approaches employ a cascaded architecture to avoid direct training with full resolution. Despite reducing computational demands, the separate optimization of each sub-stage hinders knowledge sharing and sacrifices flexibility. This work introduces a unified pyramidal flow matching algorithm. It reinterprets the original denoising trajectory as a series of pyramid stages, where only the final stage operates at the full resolution, thereby enabling more efficient video generative modeling. Through our sophisticated design, the flows of different pyramid stages can be interlinked to maintain continuity. Moreover, we craft autoregressive video generation with a temporal pyramid to compress the full-resolution history. The entire framework can be optimized in an end-to-end manner and with a single unified Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method supports generating high-quality 5-second (up to 10-second) videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS within 20.7k A100 GPU training hours.

To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training.

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformer (DiT), an emerging diffusion model for image generation, has demonstrated superior performance but suffers from substantial computational costs. Our investigations reveal that these costs stem from the static inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain diffusion timesteps and spatial regions. To address this inefficiency, we propose Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT), an architecture that dynamically adjusts its computation along both timestep and spatial dimensions during generation. Specifically, we introduce a Timestep-wise Dynamic Width (TDW) approach that adapts model width conditioned on the generation timesteps. In addition, we design a Spatial-wise Dynamic Token (SDT) strategy to avoid redundant computation at unnecessary spatial locations. Extensive experiments on various datasets and different-sized models verify the superiority of DyDiT. Notably, with <3% additional fine-tuning iterations, our method reduces the FLOPs of DiT-XL by 51%, accelerates generation by 1.73, and achieves a competitive FID score of 2.07 on ImageNet.

While scaling these models up to billions of parameters shows promise, the effectiveness of scaling beyond current sizes remains underexplored and challenging. By explicitly exploiting the computational heterogeneity of image generations, we develop a new family of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models (EC-DIT) for diffusion transformers with expert-choice routing. EC-DIT learns to adaptively optimize the compute allocated to understand the input texts and generate the respective image patches, enabling heterogeneous computation aligned with varying text-image complexities. This heterogeneity provides an efficient way of scaling EC-DIT up to 97 billion parameters and achieving significant improvements in training convergence, text-to-image alignment, and overall generation quality over dense models and conventional MoE models. Through extensive ablations, we show that EC-DIT demonstrates superior scalability and adaptive compute allocation by recognizing varying textual importance through end-to-end training. Notably, in text-to-image alignment evaluation, our largest models achieve a state-of-the-art GenEval score of 71.68% and still maintain competitive inference speed with intuitive interpretability.",

While the latest methods are primarily based on latent diffusion models with convolutional neural networks, there are few attempts to explore transformers, which have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation. In this work, we design an effective diffusion transformer for image super-resolution (DiT-SR) that achieves the visual quality of prior-based methods, but through a training-from-scratch manner. In practice, DiT-SR leverages an overall U-shaped architecture, and adopts a uniform isotropic design for all the transformer blocks across different stages. The former facilitates multi-scale hierarchical feature extraction, while the latter reallocates the computational resources to critical layers to further enhance performance. Moreover, we thoroughly analyze the limitation of the widely used AdaLN, and present a frequency-adaptive time-step conditioning module, enhancing the model's capacity to process distinct frequency information at different time steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiT-SR outperforms the existing training-from-scratch diffusion-based SR methods significantly, and even beats some of the prior-based methods on pretrained Stable Diffusion, proving the superiority of diffusion transformer in image super-resolution.",

The model also incorporates structure-aware and semantic-aware guidance to facilitate effective fusion of information from the input image.

However, most existing methods focus on generating short-form audio for short video segment (less than 10 seconds), while giving little attention to the scenario of long-form video inputs. For current UNet-based diffusion V2A models, an inevitable problem when handling long-form audio generation is the inconsistencies within the final concatenated audio. In this paper, we first highlight the importance of long-form V2A problem. Besides, we propose LoVA, a novel model for Long-form Video-to-Audio generation. Based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, LoVA proves to be more effective at generating long-form audio compared to existing autoregressive models and UNet-based diffusion models. Extensive objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that LoVA achieves comparable performance on 10-second V2A benchmark and outperforms all other baselines on a benchmark with long-form video input.",

Building on this mechanism, we additionally propose a novel Graph Diffusion Transformer GDiT architecture which is trained to iteratively denoise the weighted interaction matrix of the user-item interaction graph directly. The weighted interaction matrix is built from the bipartite structure of the user-item interaction graph and corresponding edge weights derived from user-item rating interactions.

    "abstract": "The global self-attention mechanism in diffusion transformers involves redundant computation due to the sparse and redundant nature of visual information, and the attention map of tokens within a spatial window shows significant similarity. To address this redundancy, we propose the Proxy-Tokenized Diffusion Transformer (PT-DiT), which employs sparse representative token attention (where the number of representative tokens is much smaller than the total number of tokens) to model global visual information efficiently. Specifically, within each transformer block, we compute an averaging token from each spatial-temporal window to serve as a proxy token for that region. The global semantics are captured through the self-attention of these proxy tokens and then injected into all latent tokens via cross-attention. Simultaneously, we introduce window and shift window attention to address the limitations in detail modeling caused by the sparse attention mechanism. Building on the well-designed PT-DiT, we further develop the Qihoo-T2X family, which includes a variety of models for T2I, T2V, and T2MV tasks. Experimental results show that PT-DiT achieves competitive performance while reducing the computational complexity in both image and video generation tasks (e.g., a 49% reduction compared to DiT and a 34% reduction compared to PixArt-$\\alpha$).

    "abstract": "The Diffusion Transformers Models (DiTs) have transitioned the network architecture from traditional UNets to transformers, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in image generation. Although DiTs have been widely applied to high-definition video generation tasks, their large parameter size hinders inference on edge devices. Vector quantization (VQ) can decompose model weight into a codebook and assignments, allowing extreme weight quantization and significantly reducing memory usage. In this paper, we propose VQ4DiT, a fast post-training vector quantization method for DiTs. We found that traditional VQ methods calibrate only the codebook without calibrating the assignments. This leads to weight sub-vectors being incorrectly assigned to the same assignment, providing inconsistent gradients to the codebook and resulting in a suboptimal result. To address this challenge, VQ4DiT calculates the candidate assignment set for each weight sub-vector based on Euclidean distance and reconstructs the sub-vector based on the weighted average. Then, using the zero-data and block-wise calibration method, the optimal assignment from the set is efficiently selected while calibrating the codebook. VQ4DiT quantizes a DiT XL/2 model on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU within 20 minutes to 5 hours depending on the different quantization settings. Experiments show that VQ4DiT establishes a new state-of-the-art in model size and performance trade-offs, quantizing weights to 2-bit precision while retaining acceptable image generation quality.",

Automating the generation of such visual elements improves graphic designers' productivity, democratizes and innovates the creative industry, and helps generate more realistic synthetic data for related tasks. These illustration elements are mostly RGBA images with irregular shapes and cutouts, facilitating blending and scene composition. However, most image generation models are incapable of generating such images and achieving this capability requires expensive computational resources, specific training recipes, or post-processing solutions.

We force the generation of entire subjects without sharp croppings, whose background is easily removed for seamless integration into design projects or artistic scenes. We show with a user study that, in most cases, users prefer our solution over generating and then matting an image, and we show that our generated illustrations yield good results when used as inputs for composite scene generation pipelines.

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse and high-quality text-to-image(T2I) generation. However, how text and image latents individually and jointly contribute to the semantics of generated images, remain largely unexplored. Through our investigation of DiT's latent space, we have uncovered key findings that unlock the potential for zero-shot fine-grained semantic editing: (1) Both the text and image spaces in DiTs are inherently decomposable. (2) These spaces collectively form a disentangled semantic representation space, enabling precise and fine-grained semantic control. (3) Effective image editing requires the combined use of both text and image latent spaces. Leveraging these insights, we propose a simple and effective Extract-Manipulate-Sample (EMS) framework for zero-shot fine-grained image editing. Our approach first utilizes a multi-modal Large Language Model to convert input images and editing targets into text descriptions. We then linearly manipulate text embeddings based on the desired editing degree and employ constrained score distillation sampling to manipulate image embeddings. We quantify the disentanglement degree of the latent space of diffusion models by proposing a new metric. To evaluate fine-grained editing performance, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark incorporating both human annotations, manual evaluation, and automatic metrics. We have conducted extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis to thoroughly uncover the semantic disentanglement properties of the diffusion transformer, as well as the effectiveness of our proposed method.

    "abstract": "We present xGen-VideoSyn-1, a text-to-video (T2V) generation model capable of producing realistic scenes from textual descriptions. Building on recent advancements, such as OpenAI's Sora, we explore the latent diffusion model (LDM) architecture and introduce a video variational autoencoder (VidVAE). VidVAE compresses video data both spatially and temporally, significantly reducing the length of visual tokens and the computational demands associated with generating long-sequence videos. To further address the computational costs, we propose a divide-and-merge strategy that maintains temporal consistency across video segments. Our Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model incorporates spatial and temporal self-attention layers, enabling robust generalization across different timeframes and aspect ratios. We have devised a data processing pipeline from the very beginning and collected over 13M high-quality video-text pairs. The pipeline includes multiple steps such as clipping, text detection, motion estimation, aesthetics scoring, and dense captioning based on our in-house video-LLM model. Training the VidVAE and DiT models required approximately 40 and 642 H100 days, respectively. Our model supports over 14-second 720p video generation in an end-to-end way and demonstrates competitive performance against state-of-the-art T2V models.",

    "abstract": "Medical education relies heavily on Simulated Patients (SPs) to provide a safe environment for students to practice clinical skills, including medical image analysis. However, the high cost of recruiting qualified SPs and the lack of diverse medical imaging datasets have presented significant challenges. To address these issues, this paper introduces MedDiT, a novel knowledge-controlled conversational framework that can dynamically generate plausible medical images aligned with simulated patient symptoms, enabling diverse diagnostic skill training. Specifically, MedDiT integrates various patient Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which describe the attributes and symptoms of patients, to dynamically prompt Large Language Models' (LLMs) behavior and control the patient characteristics, mitigating hallucination during medical conversation. Additionally, a well-tuned Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model is incorporated to generate medical images according to the specified patient attributes in the KG. In this paper, we present the capabilities of MedDiT through a practical demonstration, showcasing its ability to act in diverse simulated patient cases and generate the corresponding medical images. This can provide an abundant and interactive learning experience for students, advancing medical education by offering an immersive simulation platform for future healthcare professionals.

Previous video generation models often had limited movement and short durations, and is difficult to generate videos with coherent narratives based on text. We propose several designs to address these issues. First, we propose a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions, to improve both compression rate and video fidelity. Second, to improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the two modalities. Third, by employing a progressive training and multi-resolution frame pack technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration, different shape videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method, greatly contributing to the generation quality and semantic alignment.

    "abstract": "Whole-body multimodal motion generation, controlled by text, speech, or music, has numerous applications including video generation and character animation. However, employing a unified model to achieve various generation tasks with different condition modalities presents two main challenges: motion distribution drifts across different tasks (e.g., co-speech gestures and text-driven daily actions) and the complex optimization of mixed conditions with varying granularities (e.g., text and audio). Additionally, inconsistent motion formats across different tasks and datasets hinder effective training toward multimodal motion generation. In this paper, we propose MotionCraft, a unified diffusion transformer that crafts whole-body motion with plug-and-play multimodal control. Our framework employs a coarse-to-fine training strategy, starting with the first stage of text-to-motion semantic pre-training, followed by the second stage of multimodal low-level control adaptation to handle conditions of varying granularities. To effectively learn and transfer motion knowledge across different distributions, we design MC-Attn for parallel modeling of static and dynamic human topology graphs. To overcome the motion format inconsistency of existing benchmarks, we introduce MC-Bench, the first available multimodal whole-body motion generation benchmark based on the unified SMPL-X format. Extensive experiments show that MotionCraft achieves state-of-the-art performance on various standard motion generation tasks.",

Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory.",

Due to memory constraints, these models typically generate short video segments that are then combined into long videos. The merging process poses a significant challenge, as it requires ensuring smooth transitions and overall consistency. In this paper, we introduce Anchored Diffusion, a novel method for synthesizing relatively long and seamless videos. We extend Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to incorporate temporal information, creating our sequence-DiT (sDiT) model for generating short video segments. Unlike previous works, we train our model on video sequences with random non-uniform temporal spacing and incorporate temporal information via external guidance, increasing flexibility and allowing it to capture both short and long-term relationships. Furthermore, during inference, we leverage the transformer architecture to modify the diffusion process, generating a batch of non-uniform sequences anchored to a common frame, ensuring consistency regardless of temporal distance. To demonstrate our method, we focus on face reenactment, the task of creating a video from a source image that replicates the facial expressions and movements from a driving video. Through comprehensive experiments, we show our approach outperforms current techniques in producing longer consistent high-quality videos while offering editing capabilities.",

The DiT-MoE includes two simple designs: shared expert routing and expert-level balance loss, thereby capturing common knowledge and reducing redundancy among the different routed experts. When applied to conditional image generation, a deep analysis of experts specialization gains some interesting observations: (i) Expert selection shows preference with spatial position and denoising time step, while insensitive with different class-conditional information; (ii) As the MoE layers go deeper, the selection of experts gradually shifts from specific spacial position to dispersion and balance. (iii) Expert specialization tends to be more concentrated at the early time step and then gradually uniform after half. We attribute it to the diffusion process that first models the low-frequency spatial information and then high-frequency complex information. Based on the above guidance, a series of DiT-MoE experimentally achieves performance on par with dense networks yet requires much less computational load during inference. More encouragingly, we demonstrate the potential of DiT-MoE with synthesized image data, scaling diffusion model at a 16.5B parameter that attains a new SoTA FID-50K score of 1.80 in 512$\\times$512 resolution settings.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in diffusion models, particularly the architectural transformation from UNet-based models to Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), significantly improve the quality and scalability of image and video generation. However, despite their impressive capabilities, the substantial computational costs of these large-scale models pose significant challenges for real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution, enabling model compression and accelerated inference for pretrained models, without the costly retraining. However, research on DiT quantization remains sparse, and existing PTQ frameworks, primarily designed for traditional diffusion models, tend to suffer from biased quantization, leading to notable performance degradation. In this work, we identify that DiTs typically exhibit significant spatial variance in both weights and activations, along with temporal variance in activations. To address these issues, we propose Q-DiT, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates two key techniques: automatic quantization granularity allocation to handle the significant variance of weights and activations across input channels, and sample-wise dynamic activation quantization to adaptively capture activation changes across both timesteps and samples. Extensive experiments conducted on ImageNet and VBench demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Q-DiT. Specifically, when quantizing DiT-XL/2 to W6A8 on ImageNet ($256 \\times 256$), Q-DiT achieves a remarkable reduction in FID by 1.09 compared to the baseline. Under the more challenging W4A8 setting, it maintains high fidelity in image and video generation, establishing a new benchmark for efficient, high-quality quantization in DiTs.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) based on decoder-only transformers have demonstrated superior text understanding capabilities compared to CLIP and T5-series models. However, the paradigm for utilizing current advanced LLMs in text-to-image diffusion models remains to be explored. We observed an unusual phenomenon: directly using a large language model as the prompt encoder significantly degrades the prompt-following ability in image generation. We identified two main obstacles behind this issue. One is the misalignment between the next token prediction training in LLM and the requirement for discriminative prompt features in diffusion models. The other is the intrinsic positional bias introduced by the decoder-only architecture. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel framework to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs. Through the carefully designed usage guidance, we effectively enhance the text representation capability for prompt encoding and eliminate its inherent positional bias. This allows us to integrate state-of-the-art LLMs into the text-to-image generation model flexibly. Furthermore, we also provide an effective manner to fuse multiple LLMs into our framework. Considering the excellent performance and scaling capabilities demonstrated by the transformer architecture, we further design an LLM-Infused Diffusion Transformer (LI-DiT) based on the framework. We conduct extensive experiments to validate LI-DiT across model size and data size. Benefiting from the inherent ability of the LLMs and our innovative designs, the prompt understanding performance of LI-DiT easily surpasses state-of-the-art open-source models as well as mainstream closed-source commercial models including Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney V6. The LLM-Infused Diffuser framework is also one of the core technologies powering SenseMirage, a highly advanced text-to-image model.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Models (DMs) utilize an iterative denoising process to transform random noise into synthetic data. Initally proposed with a UNet structure, DMs excel at producing images that are virtually indistinguishable with or without conditioned text prompts. Later transformer-only structure is composed with DMs to achieve better performance. Though Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) reduce the computational requirement by denoising in a latent space, it is extremely expensive to inference images for any operating devices due to the shear volume of parameters and feature sizes. Post Training Quantization (PTQ) offers an immediate remedy for a smaller storage size and more memory-efficient computation during inferencing. Prior works address PTQ of DMs on UNet structures have addressed the challenges in calibrating parameters for both activations and weights via moderate optimization. In this work, we pioneer an efficient PTQ on transformer-only structure without any optimization. By analysing challenges in quantizing activations and weights for diffusion transformers, we propose a single-step sampling calibration on activations and adapt group-wise quantization on weights for low-bit quantization. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed methods with preliminary experiments on conditional image generation.",

We propose DiTFastAttn, a post-training compression method to alleviate the computational bottleneck of DiT. We identify three key redundancies in the attention computation during DiT inference: (1) spatial redundancy, where many attention heads focus on local information; (2) temporal redundancy, with high similarity between the attention outputs of neighboring steps; (3) conditional redundancy, where conditional and unconditional inferences exhibit significant similarity. We propose three techniques to reduce these redundancies: (1) Window Attention with Residual Sharing to reduce spatial redundancy; (2) Attention Sharing across Timesteps to exploit the similarity between steps; (3) Attention Sharing across CFG to skip redundant computations during conditional generation. We apply DiTFastAttn to DiT, PixArt-Sigma for image generation tasks, and OpenSora for video generation tasks.

Our empirical results confirm that this enhanced dataset, Recap-DataComp-1B, offers substantial benefits in training advanced vision-language models.

However, it is still under-explored whether the transformer-based diffuser can efficiently denoise the Gaussian noises towards superb multimodal content creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AV-DiT, a novel and efficient audio-visual diffusion transformer designed to generate high-quality, realistic videos with both visual and audio tracks. To minimize model complexity and computational costs, AV-DiT utilizes a shared DiT backbone pre-trained on image-only data, with only lightweight, newly inserted adapters being trainable. This shared backbone facilitates both audio and video generation. Specifically, the video branch incorporates a trainable temporal attention layer into a frozen pre-trained DiT block for temporal consistency. Additionally, a small number of trainable parameters adapt the image-based DiT block for audio generation. An extra shared DiT block, equipped with lightweight parameters, facilitates feature interaction between audio and visual modalities, ensuring alignment. Extensive experiments on the AIST++ and Landscape datasets demonstrate that AV-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance in joint audio-visual generation with significantly fewer tunable parameters. Furthermore, our results highlight that a single shared image generative backbone with modality-specific adaptations is sufficient for constructing a joint audio-video generator. Our source code and pre-trained models will be released.",

Despite its promising capabilities, Lumina-T2X still encounters challenges including training instability, slow inference, and extrapolation artifacts. In this paper, we present Lumina-Next, an improved version of Lumina-T2X, showcasing stronger generation performance with increased training and inference efficiency. We begin with a comprehensive analysis of the Flag-DiT architecture and identify several suboptimal components, which we address by introducing the Next-DiT architecture with 3D RoPE and sandwich normalizations. To enable better resolution extrapolation, we thoroughly compare different context extrapolation methods applied to text-to-image generation with 3D RoPE, and propose Frequency- and Time-Aware Scaled RoPE tailored for diffusion transformers. Additionally, we introduced a sigmoid time discretization schedule to reduce sampling steps in solving the Flow ODE and the Context Drop method to merge redundant visual tokens for faster network evaluation, effectively boosting the overall sampling speed. Thanks to these improvements, Lumina-Next not only improves the quality and efficiency of basic text-to-image generation but also demonstrates superior resolution extrapolation capabilities and multilingual generation using decoder-based LLMs as the text encoder, all in a zero-shot manner. To further validate Lumina-Next as a versatile generative framework, we instantiate it on diverse tasks including visual recognition, multi-view, audio, music, and point cloud generation, showcasing strong performance across these domains. By releasing all codes and model weights, we aim to advance the development of next-generation generative AI capable of universal modeling.",

We validate the effectiveness of ViDiT-Q across a variety of text-to-image and video models. While baseline quantization methods fail at W8A8 and produce unreadable content at W4A8, ViDiT-Q achieves lossless W8A8 quantization.

With the more successful results achieved by diffusion transformers (DiT), there is still a lack of exploration regarding the impact of DiT structure on generation, as well as the absence of an acceleration framework tailored to the DiT architecture. To tackle these challenges, we conduct an investigation into the correlation between DiT blocks and image generation. Our findings reveal that the front blocks of DiT are associated with the outline of the generated images, while the rear blocks are linked to the details. Based on this insight, we propose an overall training-free inference acceleration framework $\\Delta$-DiT: using a designed cache mechanism to accelerate the rear DiT blocks in the early sampling stages and the front DiT blocks in the later stages. Specifically, a DiT-specific cache mechanism called $\\Delta$-Cache is proposed, which considers the inputs of the previous sampling image and reduces the bias in the inference. Extensive experiments on PIXART-$\\alpha$ and DiT-XL demonstrate that the $\\Delta$-DiT can achieve a $1.6\\times$ speedup on the 20-step generation and even improves performance in most cases. In the scenario of 4-step consistent model generation and the more challenging $1.12\\times$ acceleration, our method significantly outperforms existing methods.

Prior works are limited to transferring product clothing images onto person videos with simple poses and backgrounds, while underperforming on casually captured videos. Recently, Sora revealed the scalability of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in generating lifelike videos featuring real-world scenarios. Inspired by this, we explore and propose the first DiT-based video try-on framework for practical in-the-wild applications, named VITON-DiT. Specifically, VITON-DiT consists of a garment extractor, a Spatial-Temporal denoising DiT, and an identity preservation ControlNet. To faithfully recover the clothing details, the extracted garment features are fused with the self-attention outputs of the denoising DiT and the ControlNet. We also introduce novel random selection strategies during training and an Interpolated Auto-Regressive (IAR) technique at inference to facilitate long video generation. Unlike existing attempts that require the laborious and restrictive construction of a paired training dataset, severely limiting their scalability, VITON-DiT alleviates this by relying solely on unpaired human dance videos and a carefully designed multi-stage training strategy. Furthermore, we curate a challenging benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of casual video try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of VITON-DiT in generating spatio-temporal consistent try-on results for in-the-wild videos with complicated human poses.",

    "abstract": "The recent introduction of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image generation by using a different backbone architecture, departing from traditional U-Nets and embracing the scalable nature of transformers. Despite their advanced capabilities, the wide deployment of DiTs, particularly for real-time applications, is currently hampered by considerable computational demands at the inference stage. Post-training Quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a fast and data-efficient solution that can significantly reduce computation and memory footprint by using low-bit weights and activations. However, its applicability to DiTs has not yet been explored and faces non-trivial difficulties due to the unique design of DiTs. In this paper, we propose PTQ4DiT, a specifically designed PTQ method for DiTs. We discover two primary quantization challenges inherent in DiTs, notably the presence of salient channels with extreme magnitudes and the temporal variability in distributions of salient activation over multiple timesteps. To tackle these challenges, we propose Channel-wise Salience Balancing (CSB) and Spearmen's $\\rho$-guided Salience Calibration (SSC). CSB leverages the complementarity property of channel magnitudes to redistribute the extremes, alleviating quantization errors for both activations and weights. SSC extends this approach by dynamically adjusting the balanced salience to capture the temporal variations in activation. Additionally, to eliminate extra computational costs caused by PTQ4DiT during inference, we design an offline re-parameterization strategy for DiTs. Experiments demonstrate that our PTQ4DiT successfully quantizes DiTs to 8-bit precision (W8A8) while preserving comparable generation ability and further enables effective quantization to 4-bit weight precision (W4A8) for the first time.",

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion architecture, Diffusion Mamba (DiM), which foregoes traditional attention mechanisms in favor of a scalable alternative. By harnessing the inherent efficiency of the Mamba architecture, DiM achieves rapid inference times and reduced computational load, maintaining linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Our architecture not only scales effectively but also outperforms existing diffusion transformers in both image and video generation tasks. The results affirm the scalability and efficiency of DiM, establishing a new benchmark for image and video generation techniques.

    "abstract": "Recent developments in large-scale pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the generation of high-fidelity images, particularly with the emergence of diffusion models based on transformer architecture (DiTs). Among these diffusion models, diffusion transformers have demonstrated superior image generation capabilities, boosting lower FID scores and higher scalability. However, deploying large-scale DiT models can be expensive due to their extensive parameter numbers. Although existing research has explored efficient deployment techniques for diffusion models such as model quantization, there is still little work concerning DiT-based models. To tackle this research gap, in this paper, we propose TerDiT, a quantization-aware training (QAT) and efficient deployment scheme for ternary diffusion models with transformers. We focus on the ternarization of DiT networks and scale model sizes from 600M to 4.2B. Our work contributes to the exploration of efficient deployment strategies for large-scale DiT models, demonstrating the feasibility of training extremely low-bit diffusion transformer models from scratch while maintaining competitive image generation capacities compared to full-precision models.

However, due to a quadratic increase in memory during generating ultra-high-resolution images (e.g. 4096*4096), the resolution of generated images is often limited to 1024*1024. In this work. we propose a unidirectional block attention mechanism that can adaptively adjust the memory overhead during the inference process and handle global dependencies.

With an isotropic architecture that chains a series of transformer blocks, DiTs demonstrate competitive performance and good scalability; but meanwhile, the abandonment of U-Net by DiTs and their following improvements is worth rethinking. To this end, we conduct a simple toy experiment by comparing a U-Net architectured DiT with an isotropic one. It turns out that the U-Net architecture only gain a slight advantage amid the U-Net inductive bias, indicating potential redundancies within the U-Net-style DiT. Inspired by the discovery that U-Net backbone features are low-frequency-dominated, we perform token downsampling on the query-key-value tuple for self-attention that bring further improvements despite a considerable amount of reduction in computation. Based on self-attention with downsampled tokens, we propose a series of U-shaped DiTs (U-DiTs) in the paper and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the extraordinary performance of U-DiT models. The proposed U-DiT could outperform DiT-XL/2 with only 1/6 of its computation cost. Codes are available at https://github.com/YuchuanTian/U-DiT.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel diffusion transformer, LazyDiffusion, that generates partial image updates efficiently. Our approach targets interactive image editing applications in which, starting from a blank canvas or an image, a user specifies a sequence of localized image modifications using binary masks and text prompts. Our generator operates in two phases. First, a context encoder processes the current canvas and user mask to produce a compact global context tailored to the region to generate. Second, conditioned on this context, a diffusion-based transformer decoder synthesizes the masked pixels in a \"lazy\" fashion, i.e., it only generates the masked region. This contrasts with previous works that either regenerate the full canvas, wasting time and computation, or confine processing to a tight rectangular crop around the mask, ignoring the global image context altogether. Our decoder's runtime scales with the mask size, which is typically small, while our encoder introduces negligible overhead. We demonstrate that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art inpainting methods in terms of quality and fidelity while providing a 10x speedup for typical user interactions, where the editing mask represents 10% of the image.",

    "abstract": "Recently, diffusion transformers have gained wide attention with its excellent performance in text-to-image and text-to-vidoe models, emphasizing the need for transformers as backbone for diffusion models. Transformer-based models have shown better generalization capability compared to CNN-based models for general vision tasks. However, much less has been explored in the existing literature regarding the capabilities of transformer-based diffusion backbones and expanding their generative prowess to other datasets. This paper focuses on enabling a single pre-trained diffusion transformer model to scale across multiple datasets swiftly, allowing for the completion of diverse generative tasks using just one model. To this end, we propose DiffScaler, an efficient scaling strategy for diffusion models where we train a minimal amount of parameters to adapt to different tasks. In particular, we learn task-specific transformations at each layer by incorporating the ability to utilize the learned subspaces of the pre-trained model, as well as the ability to learn additional task-specific subspaces, which may be absent in the pre-training dataset. As these parameters are independent, a single diffusion model with these task-specific parameters can be used to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Moreover, we find that transformer-based diffusion models significantly outperform CNN-based diffusion models methods while performing fine-tuning over smaller datasets. We perform experiments on four unconditional image generation datasets. We show that using our proposed method, a single pre-trained model can scale up to perform these conditional and unconditional tasks, respectively, with minimal parameter tuning while performing as close as fine-tuning an entire diffusion model for that particular task.",

This simple, intuitive methodology allows autoregressive (AR) transformers to learn visual distributions fast and generalize well: VAR, for the first time, makes GPT-like AR models surpass diffusion transformers in image generation. On ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VAR significantly improve AR baseline by improving Frechet inception distance (FID) from 18.65 to 1.73, inception score (IS) from 80.4 to 350.2, with around 20x faster inference speed. It is also empirically verified that VAR outperforms the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in multiple dimensions including image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability. Scaling up VAR models exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to those observed in LLMs, with linear correlation coefficients near -0.998 as solid evidence. VAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability in downstream tasks including image in-painting, out-painting, and editing. These results suggest VAR has initially emulated the two important properties of LLMs: Scaling Laws and zero-shot task generalization. We have released all models and codes to promote the exploration of AR/VAR models for visual generation and unified learning.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as the new trend of generative diffusion models on image generation. In view of extremely slow convergence in typical DiT, recent breakthroughs have been driven by mask strategy that significantly improves the training efficiency of DiT with additional intra-image contextual learning. Despite this progress, mask strategy still suffers from two inherent limitations: (a) training-inference discrepancy and (b) fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction & generative diffusion process, resulting in sub-optimal training of DiT. In this work, we address these limitations by novelly unleashing the self-supervised discrimination knowledge to boost DiT training. Technically, we frame our DiT in a teacher-student manner. The teacher-student discriminative pairs are built on the diffusion noises along the same Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE). Instead of applying mask reconstruction loss over both DiT encoder and decoder, we decouple DiT encoder and decoder to separately tackle discriminative and generative objectives. In particular, by encoding discriminative pairs with student and teacher DiT encoders, a new discriminative loss is designed to encourage the inter-image alignment in the self-supervised embedding space. After that, student samples are fed into student DiT decoder to perform the typical generative diffusion task. Extensive experiments are conducted on ImageNet dataset, and our method achieves a competitive balance between training cost and generative capacity.",

PixArt-\\Sigma represents a significant advancement over its predecessor, PixArt-\\alpha, offering images of markedly higher fidelity and improved alignment with text prompts. A key feature of PixArt-\\Sigma is its training efficiency. Leveraging the foundational pre-training of PixArt-\\alpha, it evolves from the `weaker' baseline to a `stronger' model via incorporating higher quality data, a process we term \"weak-to-strong training\". The advancements in PixArt-\\Sigma are twofold: (1) High-Quality Training Data: PixArt-\\Sigma incorporates superior-quality image data, paired with more precise and detailed image captions. (2) Efficient Token Compression: we propose a novel attention module within the DiT framework that compresses both keys and values, significantly improving efficiency and facilitating ultra-high-resolution image generation. Thanks to these improvements, PixArt-\\Sigma achieves superior image quality and user prompt adherence capabilities with significantly smaller model size (0.6B parameters) than existing text-to-image diffusion models, such as SDXL (2.6B parameters) and SD Cascade (5.1B parameters). Moreover, PixArt-\\Sigma's capability to generate 4K images supports the creation of high-resolution posters and wallpapers, efficiently bolstering the production of high-quality visual content in industries such as film and gaming.",

While existing models focus on minimizing a weighted sum of denoising score matching losses for data distribution modeling, their training primarily emphasizes instance-level optimization, overlooking valuable structural information within each mini-batch, indicative of pair-wise relationships among samples. To address this limitation, we introduce Structure-guided Adversarial training of Diffusion Models (SADM). In this pioneering approach, we compel the model to learn manifold structures between samples in each training batch. To ensure the model captures authentic manifold structures in the data distribution, we advocate adversarial training of the diffusion generator against a novel structure discriminator in a minimax game, distinguishing real manifold structures from the generated ones. SADM substantially improves existing diffusion transformers (DiT) and outperforms existing methods in image generation and cross-domain fine-tuning tasks across 12 datasets, establishing a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.58 and 2.11 on ImageNet for class-conditional image generation at resolutions of 256x256 and 512x512, respectively.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel Latent Diffusion Transformer, namely Latte, for video generation. Latte first extracts spatio-temporal tokens from input videos and then adopts a series of Transformer blocks to model video distribution in the latent space. In order to model a substantial number of tokens extracted from videos, four efficient variants are introduced from the perspective of decomposing the spatial and temporal dimensions of input videos. To improve the quality of generated videos, we determine the best practices of Latte through rigorous experimental analysis, including video clip patch embedding, model variants, timestep-class information injection, temporal positional embedding, and learning strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that Latte achieves state-of-the-art performance across four standard video generation datasets, i.e., FaceForensics, SkyTimelapse, UCF101, and Taichi-HD. In addition, we extend Latte to text-to-video generation (T2V) task, where Latte achieves comparable results compared to recent T2V models. We strongly believe that Latte provides valuable insights for future research on incorporating Transformers into diffusion models for video generation.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion inversion is the problem of taking an image and a text prompt that describes it and finding a noise latent that would generate the exact same image. Most current deterministic inversion techniques operate by approximately solving an implicit equation and may converge slowly or yield poor reconstructed images. We formulate the problem by finding the roots of an implicit equation and devlop a method to solve it efficiently. Our solution is based on Newton-Raphson (NR), a well-known technique in numerical analysis. We show that a vanilla application of NR is computationally infeasible while naively transforming it to a computationally tractable alternative tends to converge to out-of-distribution solutions, resulting in poor reconstruction and editing. We therefore derive an efficient guided formulation that fastly converges and provides high-quality reconstructions and editing. We showcase our method on real image editing with three popular open-sourced diffusion models: Stable Diffusion, SDXL-Turbo, and Flux with different deterministic schedulers. Our solution, Guided Newton-Raphson Inversion, inverts an image within 0.4 sec (on an A100 GPU) for few-step models (SDXL-Turbo and Flux.1), opening the door for interactive image editing. We further show improved results in image interpolation and generation of rare objects.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we explore Transformer-based diffusion models for image and video generation. Despite the dominance of Transformer architectures in various fields due to their flexibility and scalability, the visual generative domain primarily utilizes CNN-based U-Net architectures, particularly in diffusion-based models. We introduce GenTron, a family of Generative models employing Transformer-based diffusion, to address this gap. Our initial step was to adapt Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) from class to text conditioning, a process involving thorough empirical exploration of the conditioning mechanism. We then scale GenTron from approximately 900M to over 3B parameters, observing significant improvements in visual quality. Furthermore, we extend GenTron to text-to-video generation, incorporating novel motion-free guidance to enhance video quality. In human evaluations against SDXL, GenTron achieves a 51.1% win rate in visual quality (with a 19.8% draw rate), and a 42.3% win rate in text alignment (with a 42.9% draw rate). GenTron also excels in the T2I-CompBench, underscoring its strengths in compositional generation. We believe this work will provide meaningful insights and serve as a valuable reference for future research.",

    "abstract": "The most advanced text-to-image (T2I) models require significant training costs (e.g., millions of GPU hours), seriously hindering the fundamental innovation for the AIGC community while increasing CO2 emissions. This paper introduces PIXART-$\\alpha$, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024px resolution with low training cost, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that separately optimize pixel dependency, text-image alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch; (3) High-informative data: We emphasize the significance of concept density in text-image pairs and leverage a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning. As a result, PIXART-$\\alpha$'s training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PIXART-$\\alpha$ only takes 10.8% of Stable Diffusion v1.5's training time (675 vs. 6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly \\$300,000 (\\$26,000 vs. \\$320,000) and reducing 90% CO2 emissions. Moreover, compared with a larger SOTA model, RAPHAEL, our training cost is merely 1%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIXART-$\\alpha$ excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope PIXART-$\\alpha$ will provide new insights to the AIGC community and startups to accelerate building their own high-quality yet low-cost generative models from scratch.",

VDT offers several appealing benefits. 1) It excels at capturing temporal dependencies to produce temporally consistent video frames and even simulate the physics and dynamics of 3D objects over time. 2) It facilitates flexible conditioning information, \\eg, simple concatenation in the token space, effectively unifying different token lengths and modalities. 3) Pairing with our proposed spatial-temporal mask modeling mechanism, it becomes a general-purpose video diffuser for harnessing a range of tasks, including unconditional generation, video prediction, interpolation, animation, and completion, etc. Extensive experiments on these tasks spanning various scenarios, including autonomous driving, natural weather, human action, and physics-based simulation, demonstrate the effectiveness of VDT. Additionally, we present comprehensive studies on how \\model handles conditioning information with the mask modeling mechanism, which we believe will benefit future research and advance the field.

    "abstract": "Recent advances on text-to-image generation have witnessed the rise of diffusion models which act as powerful generative models. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to exploit such latent variable models to capture the dependency among discrete words and meanwhile pursue complex visual-language alignment in image captioning. In this paper, we break the deeply rooted conventions in learning Transformer-based encoder-decoder, and propose a new diffusion model based paradigm tailored for image captioning, namely Semantic-Conditional Diffusion Networks (SCD-Net). Technically, for each input image, we first search the semantically relevant sentences via cross-modal retrieval model to convey the comprehensive semantic information. The rich semantics are further regarded as semantic prior to trigger the learning of Diffusion Transformer, which produces the output sentence in a diffusion process. In SCD-Net, multiple Diffusion Transformer structures are stacked to progressively strengthen the output sentence with better visional-language alignment and linguistical coherence in a cascaded manner. Furthermore, to stabilize the diffusion process, a new self-critical sequence training strategy is designed to guide the learning of SCD-Net with the knowledge of a standard autoregressive Transformer model. Extensive experiments on COCO dataset demonstrate the promising potential of using diffusion models in the challenging image captioning task.

    "abstract": "The candidate supermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), is known to be fed by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF), inferred by its low accretion rate. Consequently, radiative cooling has in general been overlooked in the study of Sgr A*. However, the radiative properties of the plasma in RIAFs are poorly understood. In this work, using full 3D general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations, we study the impact of radiative cooling on the dynamical evolution of the accreting plasma, presenting spectral energy distributions and synthetic sub-millimeter images generated from the accretion flow around Sgr A*. These simulations solve the approximated equations for radiative cooling processes self-consistently, including synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton processes. We find that radiative cooling plays an increasingly important role in the dynamics of the accretion flow as the accretion rate increases: the mid-plane density grows and the infalling gas is less turbulent as cooling becomes stronger. The changes in the dynamical evolution become important when the accretion rate is larger than $10^{-8}\\,M_{\\odot}~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ ($\\gtrsim 10^{-7} \\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$, where $\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington accretion rate). The resulting spectra in the cooled models also differ from those in the non-cooled models: the overall flux, including the peak values at the sub-mm and the far-UV, is slightly lower as a consequence of a decrease in the electron temperature. Our results suggest that radiative cooling should be carefully taken into account in modelling Sgr A* and other low-luminosity active galactic nuclei that have a mass accretion rate of $\\dot{M} > 10^{-7}\\,\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$.",

We train four separate single-channel networks using: stellar mass, soft X-ray flux, bolometric X-ray flux, and the Compton $y$ parameter as observational tracers, respectively. Our training set consists of $\\sim$4800 synthetic cluster images generated from the simulation, while an additional $\\sim$3200 images form a validation set and a test set, each with 1600 images. In order to mimic real observation, these images also contain uncorrelated structures located within 50 Mpc in front and behind clusters and seen in projection, as well as instrumental systematics including noise and smoothing. In addition to CNNs for all the four observables, we also train a `multi-channel' CNN by combining the four observational tracers. The learning curves of all the five CNNs converge within 1000 epochs. The resulting predictions are especially precise for halo masses in the range $10^{13.25}M_{\\odot}<M<10^{14.5}M_{\\odot}$, where all five networks produce mean mass biases of order $\\approx$1\\% with a scatter of $\\lesssim$20\\%. The network trained with Compton $y$ parameter maps yields the most precise predictions. We interpret the network's behaviour using two diagnostic tests to determine which features are used to predict cluster mass.

The telescope will provide the unique capability of determining accurate radii for planets whose masses have already been measured from ground-based spectroscopic surveys. This will allow a first-order characterisation of the planets' internal structure through the determination of the bulk density, providing direct insight into their composition. The CHEOPS simulator has been developed to perform detailed simulations of the data which is to be received from the CHEOPS satellite. It generates accurately simulated images that can be used to explore design options and to test the on-ground data processing, in particular, the pipeline producing the photometric time series. It is, thus, a critical tool for estimating the photometric performance expected in flight and to guide photometric analysis. It can be used to prepare observations, consolidate the noise budget, and asses the performance of CHEOPS in realistic astrophysical fields that are difficult to reproduce in the laboratory. Images generated by CHEOPSim take account of many detailed effects, including variations of the incident signal flux and backgrounds, and detailed modelling of the satellite orbit, pointing jitter and telescope optics, as well as the CCD response, noise and readout. The simulator results presented in this paper have been used in the context of validating the data reduction processing chain, in which image time series generated by CHEOPSim were used to generate light curves for simulated planetary transits across real and simulated targets. Independent analysts were successfully able to detect the planets and measure their radii to an accuracy within the science requirements of the mission.",

    "abstract": "We present measurements of the properties of the central radio source in M87 using Event Horizon Telescope data obtained during the 2017 campaign. We develop and fit geometric crescent models (asymmetric rings with interior brightness depressions) using two independent sampling algorithms that consider distinct representations of the visibility data. We show that the crescent family of models is statistically preferred over other comparably complex geometric models that we explore. We calibrate the geometric model parameters using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of the emission region and estimate physical properties of the source. We further fit images generated from GRMHD models directly to the data. We compare the derived emission region and black hole parameters from these analyses with those recovered from reconstructed images. There is a remarkable consistency among all methods and data sets. We find that >50% of the total flux at arcsecond scales comes from near the horizon, and that the emission is dramatically suppressed interior to this region by a factor >10, providing direct evidence of the predicted shadow of a black hole. Across all methods, we measure a crescent diameter of 42+/-3 micro-as and constrain its fractional width to be <0.5. Associating the crescent feature with the emission surrounding the black hole shadow, we infer an angular gravitational radius of GM/Dc2 = 3.8+/- 0.4 micro-as. Folding in a distance measurement of 16.8(+0.8,-0.7) Mpc gives a black hole mass of M = 6.5 +/- 0.2(stat) +/-0.7(sys) 10^9 Msun. This measurement from lensed emission near the event horizon is consistent with the presence of a central Kerr black hole, as predicted by the general theory of relativity.",

Therefore, an independent flux density scaling solution per image is calculated via bootstrapping, comparing the measured apparent brightness of sources in the field to a reference catalogue. However, the lack of accurate flux density measurements of bright sources below 74 MHz necessitated the creation of the AARTFAAC source catalogue, at 60 MHz, which contains 167 sources across the Northern Hemisphere.

    "abstract": "We present a catalogue of ALMA flux density measurements of 754 calibrators observed between August 2012 and September 2017, for a total of 16,263 observations in different bands and epochs. The flux densities were measured reprocessing the ALMA images generated in the framework of the ALMACAL project, with a new code developed by the Italian node of the European ALMA Regional Centre. A search in the online databases yielded redshift measurements for 589 sources ($\\sim$78 per cent of the total). Almost all sources are flat-spectrum, based on their low-frequency spectral index, and have properties consistent with being blazars of different types. To illustrate the properties of the sample we show the redshift and flux density distributions as well as the distributions of the number of observations of individual sources and of time spans in the source frame for sources observed in bands 3 (84$-$116 GHz) and 6 (211$-$275 GHz). As examples of the scientific investigations allowed by the catalogue we briefly discuss the variability properties of our sources in ALMA bands 3 and 6 and the frequency spectra between the effective frequencies of these bands. We find that the median variability index steadily increases with the source-frame time lag increasing from 100 to 800 days, and that the frequency spectra of BL Lacs are significantly flatter than those of flat-spectrum radio quasars. We also show the global spectral energy distributions of our sources over 17 orders of magnitude in frequency.",

    "abstract": "We introduce ProFound, a source finding and image analysis package. ProFound provides methods to detect sources in noisy images, generate segmentation maps identifying the pixels belonging to each source, and measure statistics like flux, size and ellipticity. These inputs are key requirements of ProFit, our recently released galaxy profiling package, where the design aim is that these two software packages will be used in unison to semi-automatically profile large samples of galaxies. The key novel feature introduced in ProFound is that all photometry is executed on dilated segmentation maps that fully contain the identifiable flux, rather than using more traditional circular or ellipse based photometry. Also, to be less sensitive to pathological segmentation issues, the de-blending is made across saddle points in flux. We apply ProFound in a number of simulated and real world cases, and demonstrate that it behaves reasonably given its stated design goals. In particular, it offers good initial parameter estimation for ProFit, and also segmentation maps that follow the sometimes complex geometry of resolved sources, whilst capturing nearly all of the flux. A number of bulge-disc decomposition projects are already making use of the ProFound and ProFit pipeline, and adoption is being encouraged by publicly releasing the software for the open source R data analysis platform under an LGPL-3 license on GitHub (github.com/asgr/ProFound).",

    "abstract": "The signatures of energy release and energy transport for a kink-unstable coronal flux rope are investigated via forward modelling. Synthetic intensity and Doppler maps are generated from a 3D numerical simulation. The CHIANTI database is used to compute intensities for three Hinode/EIS emission lines that cover the thermal range of the loop. The intensities and Doppler velocities at simulation resolution are spatially degraded to the Hinode/EIS pixel size (1\\arcsec), convolved using a Gaussian point-spread function (3\\arcsec), and exposed for a characteristic time of 50 seconds. The synthetic images generated for rasters (moving slit) and sit-and-stare (stationary slit) are analysed to find the signatures of the twisted flux and the associated instability. We find that there are several qualities of a kink-unstable coronal flux rope that can be detected observationally using Hinode/EIS, namely the growth of the loop radius, the increase in intensity towards the radial edge of the loop, and the Doppler velocity following an internal twisted magnetic field line. However, EIS cannot resolve the small, transient features present in the simulation, such as sites of small-scale reconnection (e.g. nanoflares)",

    "abstract": "We present an overview and first results of the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey, which is using the FORCAST instrument to image massive protostars from $\\sim10$--$40\\:\\rm{\\mu}\\rm{m}$. These wavelengths trace thermal emission from warm dust, which in Core Accretion models mainly emerges from the inner regions of protostellar outflow cavities. Dust in dense core envelopes also imprints characteristic extinction patterns at these wavelengths, causing intensity peaks to shift along the outflow axis and profiles to become more symmetric at longer wavelengths. We present observational results for the first eight protostars in the survey, i.e., multiwavelength images, including some ancillary ground-based MIR observations and archival {\\it{Spitzer}} and {\\it{Herschel}} data. These images generally show extended MIR/FIR emission along directions consistent with those of known outflows and with shorter wavelength peak flux positions displaced from the protostar along the blueshifted, near-facing sides, thus confirming qualitative predictions of Core Accretion models. We then compile spectral energy distributions and use these to derive protostellar properties by fitting theoretical radiative transfer models. Zhang and Tan models, based on the Turbulent Core Model of McKee and Tan, imply the sources have protostellar masses $m_*\\sim10$--50$\\:M_\\odot$ accreting at $\\sim10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}\\:M_\\odot\\:{\\rm{yr}}^{-1}$ inside cores of initial masses $M_c\\sim30$--500$\\:M_\\odot$ embedded in clumps with mass surface densities $\\Sigma_{\\rm{cl}}\\sim0.1$--3$\\:{\\rm{g\\:cm}^{-2}}$. Fitting Robitaille et al. models typically leads to slightly higher protostellar masses, but with disk accretion rates $\\sim100\\times$ smaller. We discuss reasons for these differences and overall implications of these first survey results for massive star formation theories.",

    "abstract": "It has been argued that the flux anomalies detected in gravitationally lensed QSOs are evidence for substructures in the foreground lensing haloes. In this paper we investigate this issue in greater detail focusing on the Cusp relation which corresponds to images of a source located to the cusp of the inner caustic curve. We use numerical simulations combined with a Monte Carlo approach to study the effects of the expected power law distribution of substructures within LCDM haloes on the multiple images.   Generally, the high number of anomalous flux ratios in the cusp configurations is unlikely explained by 'simple' perturbers (subhaloes) inside the lensing galaxy, either modeled by point masses or extended NFW subhaloes. We considered in our analysis a mass range of 10^5-10^7 Msun for the subhaloes. We also demonstrate that including the effects of the surrounding mass distribution, such as other galaxies close to the primary lens, does not change the results. We conclude that triple images of lensed QSOs do not show any direct evidence for dark dwarf galaxies such as cold dark matter substructure.",
